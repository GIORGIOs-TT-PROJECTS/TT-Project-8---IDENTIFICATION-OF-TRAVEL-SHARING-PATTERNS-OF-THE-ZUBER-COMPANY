# IDENTIFICATION OF TRAVEL SHARING PATTERNS OF THE ZUBER COMPANY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project involves analyzing data for Zuber, a ridesharing startup launching in Chicago. Our goal is to understand rider preferences and the impact of external factors, such as weather, on trip frequency. We will analyze weather data, analyze taxi trip data, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on trip frequency.

### STEP 6: HYPOTHESIS TEST


## CONCLUSION

In this project, we analyzed SATURDAY ridesharing data from November 2017. First, we identified the most successful business partners, highlighting Flash Cab as the leading taxi company, with almost twice as many trips as its closest competitor. We also observed that most of our customers were heading to the Loop neighborhood. Next, we investigated how weather conditions influenced trip durations. The analyses showed that trips were longer on rainy days. Our hypothesis testing confirmed that trip durations were significantly different between days with good and bad weather. One possible explanation is that on rainy days, people tend to be more careful when driving and slow down, which increases trip time; another may be that more people opt for taxis or ride-hailing, which increases traffic.
